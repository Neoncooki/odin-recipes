Recipes project for TOP

	In this project I will be applying the fundamentals of web development through the creation of an HTML file where the content i will later stylize and add interactivity to will be stored.
.
 	I have succesfully recreated a very basic HTML site for three different recipes. This project gave me hands on experience writing an HTML boilerplate and linking different html files together.
