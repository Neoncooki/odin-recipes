    <h2>What is Picanha?</h2>
    <p>The top sirloin cap is also known as <em>picanha</em> (pronounced "pee-KAHN-ya")—the specialty of a
        <em>churrascaria</em>
        or Brazilian steakhouse.
    </p>
    <p>The flavorful meat is skewered, grilled, and sliced before serving.</p>
    <p> It's relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to ribeyes and other notable steaks, and is packed with
        beef flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 to 4 pounds picanha beef</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>High heat oil, for greasing the grill</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>If the steak has been refrigerated, take it out 1 hour before you preheat the grill and let it come to room
            temperature.</li>
        <li>Lay the top sirloin cap flat on a cutting board or another work surface, fat-side up. Using a small sharp
            knife, cut the fat layer, without cutting to the meat, in a cross-hatch pattern, as you would do for a ham.
        </li>
        <li>Massage 1 tablespoon of salt into crevices of the cross-hatched fat layer of the steak. Season with freshly
            ground black pepper. </li>
        <li>If you want to skewer the steak, cut the steak lengthwise into three equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each steak piece like a jelly-roll and, using a large metal skewer, secure the steak so it holds
            together rolled up. Sprinkle the remaining salt over the unseasoned sides of the steak.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Clean the grates well and apply a thin layer of oil using a brush or paper towel.
            Lay the skewered picanha on the grill and turn off all heat except for the one burner furthest away from the
            steaks. Alternatively, heat a <em>charcoal</em> grill until very hot before carefully scraping the coals to
            the back of the grill. Immediately add the steak to the front side of the grill</li>
        <li>Cook the steaks—with the grill cover closed—for 20 to 25 minutes, turning them every 5 to 7 minutes to
            ensure even cooking. When the internal temperature reaches 128 F to 130 F for medium-rare on an
            <em>instant-read thermometer</em>, take the picanha off the grill.
        </li>
        <li>Let the steaks rest 5 minutes, then remove from the skewer and slice against the grain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
